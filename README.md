# Smart Calculator
 
The calculator performs addition, subtraction, multiplication and integer division of an arbitrary number of integers.\n
It supports both unary and binary minus and plus operators.\n
Each operator + or - can be entered several times following each other.
Examples:     ---4 ++ 5 -8 ---2
              2*(-4---5)\*3+9/4
It also allows one to use variables, whose names should consist only from letters.
Examples: aba = 2+15/5, c = -1-3*aba-6, c/aba -56
Two commands: /help and /exit are supported as well.
